# Concurrent programming (Go)

URL to the original repository I made: https://github.com/kienmarkdo/Taxi-Geolocation-Clustering-DBSCAN

In this Go version of the comprehensive project, the [DBSCAN algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) is run concurrently on partitions of the Trip Record data. The partitions are created by dividing the geographical area into a grid of NxN. The following figure illustrates the case of a partition made of 4x4 cells (NOTE: In this case, the DBSCAN algorithm would run on 16 concurrent threads):

## How to run
Make sure [Go](https://go.dev/) is downloaded.

Include the dataset file `yellow_tripdata_2009-01-15_9h_21h_clean.csv` in the same directory as `mainFinal.go`.

Run the file `mainFinal.go` in the command line with `go run mainFinal.go`.


## Implementation
### General algorithm (MapReduce pattern)
The parallel DBSCAN algorithm is based on the [MapReduce pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce), a widely used pattern in concurrent programming, and proceeds as follows:
  1. Map the data into overlapping partitions (the overlap with other partitions must be at least equals to eps along its border)
  2. Apply the DBSCAN algorithm over each partition.
  3. Reduce the results by collecting the clusters from all partitions. Intersecting clusters must be merged.

In other words, the steps are: create partitions, concurrently perform DBSCAN on each partition, merge the partitions to get one big result. However, the 3rd step (merging the partitions step) will not be implemented as we are only interested in the concurrency aspect (step 2) of this Go version of the project. The 3rd step will be implemented in the Prolog version of the project.

**NOTE:** The 3rd step (Merge/Reduce) is skipped in this implementation. It is implemented in the Prolog version of this project.

### Experimentation
This concurrent version of the DBSCAN algorithm is implemented with the [producer-consumer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) based on the [thread pool pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool), specifically the [Single Producer Multiple Consumer variation](https://betterprogramming.pub/hands-on-go-concurrency-the-producer-consumer-pattern-c42aab4e3bd2). The experimentation is carried out with different **numbers of partitions** and **consumer threads** in order to observe the optimal solution. A [semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)#Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) structure is implemented for the producer-consumer problem.

### Additional Notes
The DBSCAN implementation has a restricted minimum point of `GPScoord{-74., 40.7}` and a maximum point of `GPScoord{-73.93, 40.8}`. These coordinates represent the area of downtown Manhattan, NYC.

If we were to create partitions on the entire city of New York, one or two partitions in the downtown Manhattan area would be doing a lot of the work to cluster the points (because that area is busier than the rest of the city). Meanwhile, the number of clusters around the city would be very small, giving those partitions almost no work to do. This would defeat the purpose of concurrency; therefore, the boundaries of the partitioning step (step 1 of MapReduce) will only be restricted to the downtown Manhattan area for maximum efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from NYC's 2009 taxi database that recorded taxi trips in the span of **12 hours** (from 9h to 21h) on January 15, 2009. The dataset is contained in a CSV file, with each line corresponding to a trip record and the columns representing the relevant attributes of each trip, and contains _232,051_ points.

_Note: This dataset cannot be plotted on Google Maps due to the sheer size of the CSV file._

## Takeaways
Of course, no one can build a project without running into problems. Since I dealt with concurrency in this version of the project, most of the challenges I encountered were regarding the efficiency of my program. 

I learned that the built-in `math.Pow()` function is significantly slower than simply doing `num*num` as the built-in function has additional error checking mechanisms. This modification significantly reduced the execution time by several minutes. 

I also learned that it is much slower to check whether an item is in a slice by writing a `contains()` function than to convert the slice into a map then removing the duplicate keys ([see problem and solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66643946/how-to-remove-duplicates-strings-or-int-from-slice-in-go)).
